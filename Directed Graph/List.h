typedef struct NodeObj *Node;

// private QueueObj type
typedef struct ListObj *List;

// Constructors-Destructors ---------------------------------------------------
List newList(void); // returns a List which points to a new empty list object

void freeList(List *pL); // frees all heap memory associated with its List* argument,
// and sets *pL to NULL


// Access functions -----------------------------------------------------------
int length(List L); // Returns the number of nodes in this List.

int frontValue(List L);// Returns the integer in the front Node.
// Precondition: L has at least one Node on it.

int backValue(List L); // Returns the integer in the back Node.
// Precondition: L has at least one Node on it.

int getValue(Node N); // Returns the integer in Node N.
// Precondition: N is not NULL

int equals(List A, List B); // Returns 1 if if List A and List B are the same integer
// sequence, otherwise returns 0.


// Manipulation procedures ----------------------------------------------------
void clear(List L); // Resets this List to the empty state.

Node getFront(List L); // If List is non-empty, returns the front Node, without
// changing the List. Otherwise, does nothing.

Node getBack(List L); // If List is non-empty, returns the back Node, without
// changing the List. Otherwise, does nothing.

Node getPrevNode(Node N); // Without changing the List that N is on, returns the
// Node that is previous to Node N on its List. If
// there is no previous Node, returns NULL.

Node getNextNode(Node N); // Without changing the List that N is on, returns the
// Node that is next after Node N on its List. If
// there is no next Node, returns NULL.

void prepend(List L, int data); // Inserts a new Node into List L before the front
// Node that has data as its value. If List is empty,
// makes that new Node the only Node on the list.

void append(List L, int data); // Inserts a new Node into List L after the back
// Node that has data as its value. If List is empty,
// makes that new Node the only Node on the list.

void insertBefore(List L, Node N, int data); // Insert a new Node into Node N’s list
// before Node N that has data as its value.
// Assume that Node N is on List L. If Node N is
// the front of List L, then the new Node becomes the new
// front.
// Precondition: Node N is not NULL

void insertAfter(List L, Node N, int data); // Insert a new Node into Node N’s list
// after Node N that has data as its value.
// Assume that Node N is on List L. If Node N is
// the back of List L, then the new Node becomes the new
// back.
// Precondition: Node N is not NULL

void deleteFront(List L); // Deletes the front Node in List L.
// Precondition: L has at least one Node on it.

void deleteBack(List L); // Deletes the back Node in List L.
// Precondition: L has at least one Node on it.


// Other operations -----------------------------------------------------------
void printList(FILE *out, List L); // Prints the values in List L from front to back
// to the file pointed to by out, formatted as a
// space-separated string.
// For those familiar with Java, this is similar
// to toString()in Java.
// Optional Manipulation procedures -------------------------------------------------

void detachNode(List L, Node N); // This operation is optional.
// Removes N from List L by making the Node before
// Node N link to the Node that’s after Node N as its
// next Node, and making the Node after Node N link to
// the Node that’s before Node N as its previous Node.
//
// After detachNode, Node N should have NULL as both its
// next and previous Nodes.
//
// Special cases:
//
// If Node N is the front the List L, then the Node after
// Node N becomes the front of List L, which should have
// a NULL previous Node.
//
// If Node N is the back of List L, then the Node before
// Node N becomes the back of List L, which should have
// a NULL next Node.
//
// Precondition: N is not NULL and N is a Node on List L.

void deleteNode(List L, Node N); // This operation is optional.
// Deletes Node N from List L.
// Removes N from List L by making the Node before
// Node N link to the Node that’s after Node N as its
// next Node, and making the Node after Node N link to
// the Node that’s before Node N as its previous Node.
//
// Special cases:
//
// If Node N is the front the List L, then the Node after
// Node N becomes the front of List L, which should have
// a NULL previous Node.
//
// If Node N is the back of List L, then the Node before
// Node N becomes the back of List L, which should have
// a NULL next Node.
//
// Precondition: N is not NULL and N is a Node on List L.

void attachNodeBetween(List L, Node N, Node N1, Node N2);
// This operation is optional.
// Attaches Node N between Nodes N1 and N2. Makes N1's
// next Node be N, and N's previous Node be N1. Makes
// N2's previous Node be N, and N's next Node be N2.
//
// Special cases:
//
// If N1 is NULL and N2 is the front of List L, makes N
// the front of List L, which should have a NULL
// previous Node, and whose next Node should be N2.
//
// If N1 is the back of List L and N2 is NULL, makes N
// the back of List L, which should have a NULL next
// Node, and whose previous Node should be N1.
//
// Preconditions: N1 and N2 are adjacent nodes on List
// L, with N2 being N1's next node and N1's being N2's
// previous node. If N1 is NULL, then N2 is the front of
// list L. If N2 is NULL, then N1 is the back of List L.
